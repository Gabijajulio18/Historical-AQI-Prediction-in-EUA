Using a local dataset from Kaggle accelerates development and makes this project reproducible.

# Estimating Missing AQI Values for SO‚ÇÇ and CO

## üìå Background

During our exploratory data analysis of the [US Pollution Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sogun3/uspollution), we observed a consistent issue:

- **Over 50% of the AQI values for SO‚ÇÇ and CO are missing**, even though the corresponding pollutant concentrations (`Mean`, `1st Max Value`, etc.) are available.

## üîç Problem Description

While NO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÉ AQI values are fully present, SO‚ÇÇ and CO AQI values show the following characteristics:

- The **raw pollutant data is present** ‚Äî sensors have collected `SO2 Mean`, `CO Mean`, etc.
- However, the **AQI values themselves are missing** in about **half the rows**.
- The missingness appears **systematic**, not random:
  - It affects the same percentage of data per state, site, and date.
  - This likely suggests **AQI was not computed** or stored in the original dataset.

This poses a problem if we intend to:
- Compare AQI across pollutants,
- Forecast AQI for SO‚ÇÇ and CO,
- Build dashboards using AQI data.

## üí° Solution: Estimate AQI Using EPA Breakpoints

To address this, we are implementing a function that:

- Uses **EPA AQI breakpoint tables** to **recalculate the AQI** for SO‚ÇÇ and CO from their corresponding mean concentration values.
- Ensures consistency with officially defined AQI ranges and pollutant-specific formulas.
- Produces a **complete AQI dataset**, allowing for fair comparisons and more accurate visualizations/forecasts.

We will apply these functions to fill in missing AQI values for SO‚ÇÇ and CO where pollutant concentration data is available.

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- Enables forecasting and modeling using AQI as a target variable.
- Maintains the integrity of time series and spatial analyses.
- Provides transparency and consistency in how AQI values are handled across the dataset.
